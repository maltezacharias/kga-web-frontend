## Backend

See kga-web(https://github.com/maltezacharias/kga-web) for the backend.

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:maltezacharias/kga-web-frontend.git
$ cd kga-web-frontend
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/kga-web-frontend/build/index.html` in your browser.

## Status

Unfinished Prototype in development

## Purpose

`kga-web-frontend` is designed to facilitate students sign-up for study groups for small
group teaching sessions. It's loosely based on an already existing system in use today.
Hopefully this prototype will inspire change once it's finished and has been shown to be
able to fulfill the requirements of being used by >500 students simultaneously, a large part
of which will depend on the backend (see above).

Also I always wanted to try to create an angular SPA...
